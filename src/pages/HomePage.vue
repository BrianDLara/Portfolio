        <p class="xl:text-xl xl:px-8 mx-8 xl:mx-36 mt-16 xl:mt-24">I have learned that maximizing the limited time we have is crucial. Personally, acquiring U.S Citizenship ranks high among my life's proudest accomplishments. This milestone has opened up a world of possibilities and enabled me to chase my dreams and passions.</p>

        <p class="xl:text-xl xl:px-8 mx-8 xl:mx-36 mt-8">My previous career as a Commercial Roofing Foreman, allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills. This job did not only teach me how to work collaboratively with teams, but also how to lead them through high quality projects in deadline-driven environments.</p>

        <p class="xl:text-xl xl:px-8 mx-8 xl:mx-36 mt-8">When I'm not working, I spend all my time with my family. I have a great time baking with my daughter and can't wait until she's old enough to join me on many hiking adventures.</p>

        <p class="xl:text-xl xl:px-8 mx-8 xl:mx-36 mt-8"> I am excited to combine my technical and people skills to help companies and their engineering teams succeed.</p>
